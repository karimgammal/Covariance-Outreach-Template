                                <strong>Subject:</strong> Win the CPG product war with stealth competitor data‚Äîdaily, not quarterly<br><br>

                                Hi [Name],<br><br>

                                Imagine seeing product-level competitor sales in near real-time‚Äîeven from private brands. Covariance.ai leverages MIT's "inverse problem" algorithms, validated in Fortune 100 CPG and ecommerce, to reconstruct detailed sku-level sales and launch timelines from anonymized aggregate spend data‚Äîat both public and private competitors.<br><br>

                                Last month, a top-5 beverage CMO used Covariance to anticipate a rival's stealth launch 5 weeks before market chatter started, pivoting their own SKU rollout, and securing a first-mover win. No more flying blind: our platform auto-detects launches, promo spikes, and supply chain demand shifts days, not months, before syndicated POS data can catch up.<br><br>

                                <strong>What's unique for [Company]:</strong><br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Can identify competitor launches before your distributors or Nielsen data<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ See granular sales trends by SKU/category even if your rival is private<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Measure promo/supply impact at both aggregate and store level<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Plug directly into your insights and planning tools<br><br>

                                Would 20 minutes to see your competitive blind spots and roadmap new launch defenses be helpful?<br><br>

                                Best,<br>
                                [Your Name]

                                Noticed [Company]'s drive for omnichannel growth. Most CPG/ecom leaders only see competitors' moves well after the fact, especially when those rivals are private. Covariance.ai's MIT algorithms reconstruct their product-level sales and launches from nothing but anonymized purchase aggregates‚Äîproven at top-10 brands.<br><br>

                                Would you like to see what real, daily competitor intelligence could look like for [Company]? No demo fluff‚Äîactual stealth launches, down to SKU, mapped for your core category.<br><br>

                                Your leadership in [Company]'s market expansion has been impressive. Most CPG executives are limited to 90-day-old syndicated data when making critical competitive decisions.<br><br>
                                MIT's breakthrough algorithms enable Fortune 100 brands to reconstruct competitor sales data in near real-time‚Äîincluding private brands that traditional POS data cannot track.<br><br>
                                Recent example: A $3B consumer goods leader identified a competitor's stealth product launch 6 weeks early, enabling a defensive strategy that protected significant market share.<br><br>
